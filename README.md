# Computational Physics – Research-Grade Evaluation Tasks

This repository contains **research-style computational physics evaluation tasks**
designed to assess:
- physical reasoning
- numerical correctness
- scientific Python proficiency
- verification and interpretability

The tasks are intentionally **open-ended**, mirroring evaluation problems used in
research labs such as OpenAI and Anthropic.

## Evaluation Philosophy
Each task emphasizes:
- explicit physical assumptions
- numerical stability and convergence
- reference solutions, not heuristics
- inspectable Python implementations

## Tasks Included
1. 2D Poisson Equation Solver for Semiconductor Heterostructures
2. Stochastic Noise Simulation and Spectral Validation

## Environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
